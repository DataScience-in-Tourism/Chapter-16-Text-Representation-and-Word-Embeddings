小时开始，日落时分结束），大家将跟随我与Matteo一起走进这个浓缩了 年罗马史的平民区，除了历史轶事之外，我也会详细讲述罗马各种令人匪夷所思的传说和意大利传统艺术形式（湿壁画、马赛克等）的制作方法，而Matteo会向大家介绍他在这个街区成长的趣事与罗马的民俗文化。旅程中主要途径的景点如下：  圣玛利亚大教堂与同名广场 （Basilica di Santa Maria in Trastevere）穿过曲折狭窄的巷子，眼前忽然开阔。相传，这座圣殿是罗马第一个举行弥撒仪式的地点，也是第一座献给圣母玛利亚的教堂。它的历史可以追溯到基督教还没有普及的公元 世纪，如今我们所看到的是 世纪重建后的面貌。同样古老的还有广场上的喷泉，古罗马时代它就已是一个取水口，布拉曼特与贝尔尼尼两位大师给予了它今日的外观。 西斯托古桥与台伯河沿岸 （Ponte Sisto）台伯河，代表了罗马的灵魂，但同时也带给这座它孕育的城市无数的灾难，西斯托古桥就是最好的历史证明。在 多年的历史中，因为洪水的缘故，它不断地经历坍塌、修复和重建。在还没有筑起河提的年代，人们通过观察桥身上那个被称为 “罗马之眼”的圆环来判断水灾的来临。 伦加拉街（Via della Lungara） 一条古老的街道，古罗马时期它是帝王花园与法外之地的交集，中世纪时期它是通往圣彼得大教堂的朝圣之路，文艺复兴时期它是达官贵族们修筑别院的钟情之处。塞维鲁城门、猞猁之眼国家科学院、法尔内西纳别墅、天皇后监狱，它们代表了一个又一个重要的历史片段。 拉斐尔情人的故居 （Casa della Fornarina）也许你没有听过她的名字，但你却很可能在拉斐尔的诸多作品中见过她的脸庞。他年纪轻轻就已是那个时代最受追捧的艺术家，而她，玛格丽特，只是平民区中一个面包师的女儿。如今，她曾经住过的房子依然竖立在那个巷口，遥望着他在一街之隔的宫殿里所留下的绝美画作。 布拉曼特礼拜堂（Tempietto del Bramante）艺术史的必修课，教科书中的经典，文艺复兴理念的完美展现。整个建筑的中心直指圣彼得殉难十字架的所在之处。布拉曼特，这位曾参与设计圣彼得大教堂的建筑大师一生作品无数，然而这座小小的八角形礼拜堂才是其最有影响力的代表作。 宝拉喷泉（ Fontana dell’Acqua Paola）曾经看过穷游锦囊的一个提问“你有被一张图片种草而前往一个旅行目的地的经历吗？”，某位驴友的回答就是这座出现在《绝美之城》第一幕中的喷泉。尽管比起著名的许愿池而言，它是朴素的，但是它依然足够令你难忘，因为它竖立在山巅之上，面对的是整座永恒之城。 贾尼科洛山丘观景台（Terrazza del Gianicolo）每到夕阳西下之时，总会有一些当地的爱侣来到这里，他们挽着手漫步在山顶的林荫大道，安静地欣赏着落日的余晖洒在鳞次栉比的屋顶上。而对于游客来说，在 °的观景台上面对壮观的罗马全景，细数白天走过的路、参观过的景点不失为一种有趣的体验。  Please join me for a personalised farm to table experience at the Nesta
